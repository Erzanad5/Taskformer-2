# Automated LinkedIn Outreach Tool

## Project Description

This project automates the extraction of LinkedIn profile data from a Google Sheet, crafts personalized outreach messages using OpenAI, and facilitates email delivery to potential leads. The primary focus is on introducing a business automation solution and scheduling demonstrations with interested clients.

## Key Features

- **Profile Data Extraction:** Automatically scrapes vital information such as names, job titles, companies, and emails from LinkedIn profiles.
- **Custom Message Generation:** Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to produce tailored outreach messages.
- **Automated Emailing:** Sends the personalized messages directly via email.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Retrieves LinkedIn profile URLs from a specified Google Sheet.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following:

1. **Google Sheets API Setup:**
   - Activate the Google Sheets API and download the `credentials.json` file from the Google Cloud Console.
   - Place the credentials file in the root folder of your project.

2. **Selenium WebDriver:**
   - Download the correct version of ChromeDriver for your operating system.
   - Verify that the ChromeDriver path is correctly specified in your script.

3. **OpenAI API Key:**
   - Acquire an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and insert it into your script.

4. **SMTP Configuration:**
   - Use an email account (e.g., Gmail) that has SMTP enabled for sending emails.
   - For Gmail, ensure that "Less secure app access" is enabled or use OAuth2 for more secure authentication.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
   cd repo-name
Install Required Libraries: Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:

Copy code
gspread
oauth2client
selenium
openai
Then, install the libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Google Sheets API Credentials:

Follow the instructions here to set up your Google Sheets API credentials.
Place your credentials JSON file in the project directory and update the script accordingly.
Environment Configuration: Modify the script or create a .env file with your credentials:

OpenAI API key
Email account (SMTP) details
Google Sheets API credentials
ChromeDriver Setup:

Download ChromeDriver from this link.
Ensure the path to the ChromeDriver executable is correctly set in your script.
Configuration Details
Before executing the script, make sure to update the following placeholders in the code:

path/to/your/credentials.json - Path to your Google Sheets API credentials.
your_google_sheet_id - The ID of the Google Sheet containing LinkedIn profile URLs.
your_linkedin_email - Your LinkedIn email address.
your_linkedin_password - Your LinkedIn password.
your_openai_api_key - Your OpenAI API key.
your_email@example.com - Your email for sending outreach messages.
your_email_password - Your email account password for SMTP authentication.
How to Execute
Run the Script: Once all configurations are complete, execute the script with:

bash
Copy code
python linkedin_outreach.py
Expected Output:

The script will scrape LinkedIn profiles, generate personalized messages, and send emails to the respective contacts.
Troubleshooting Guide
Email Sending Failures:

Confirm that your SMTP settings are correct and your email provider allows automated emails.
For Gmail, enable "Less secure apps" or set up OAuth2 for enhanced security.
LinkedIn Scraping Challenges:

Be aware that LinkedIn may block automated scraping attempts or require captcha verification.
If email extraction fails, ensure that the XPath selectors in the script are up-to-date with LinkedInâ€™s current structure.
Google Sheets API Issues:

Double-check that your API credentials are valid and the spreadsheet link is accurately referenced in the script.
